    - Music notation systems have used letters of the alphabet for centuries. 
    - The seven notes in alphabetical notation are: `A B C D E F G` but starts from C instead of A.
* Solmization
    - Solmization is a music system of attributing a distinct syllable to each note in a musical scale. 
    - Solfège and Sargam are two such solmization systems.

### Octave
* In music, an octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency.
* The most important musical scales are typically written using eight notes, and the interval between the first and last 
  notes is an octave.
* For example, the C major scale is typically written C D E F G A B C, the initial and final Cs being an octave apart.
* There are 12 tones per octave.
* The five tones that are in between the basic seven and are called "half-tones".

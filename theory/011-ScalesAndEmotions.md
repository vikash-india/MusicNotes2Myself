### Musical Key Characteristics
Below is a list of commonly used key, major and minor, along with a succinct version of their emotive expression and 
also include a more verbose explanation so one can really dig deep for what she is looking to get across to her 
listeners. A German music theorist and composer John Mattheson laid it out in his writings way back in 1713, among many 
other related topics. They were rediscovered and translated by Rita Steblin in her book A History of Key Characteristics 
in the 18th and Early 19th Centuries in 1983.
